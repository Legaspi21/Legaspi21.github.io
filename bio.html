			<h1>Bio</h1>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aidan "Fetty Slaps" Legaspi is a Record Producer, Audio Engineer and Songwriter who hails from San Diego, California with over 12 years of experience in the music business. Although he is well known and respected for his work in the Hip-Hop genre, Fetty is a versitile creator who's music commonly incorporates elements unique to Pop, R&amp;B, Soul and Electronic Music. It is not unusual for Fetty's name to be mentioned among the most elite producers in his hometown, the second largest city in California. In fact, a well known DJ once claimed Fetty could very well be "the hottest producer in the city"! <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aidan currently has a hands-on role in the production and development of a number of top up and coming independent acts in regions spanning from the East to the West Coast of the US. Recently migrating from San Diego to the San Francisco Bay Area, expect Fetty Slaps to continue expanding his brand and working with top local talent, already releasing a single with buzzworthy Sacramento artist "Mozzy" and the full length LP "Chicken Talk" with Oakland rap heavywieght "Lil Blood" and San Diego's "Top Shelf Twelve". With singles like "Choosey Lover" featuring Grammy Nominated artist "Yung Joc" and "Scanners" featuring Platinum recording artist "Jim Jones" currently burning up the airwaves, it's only a matter of time until Fetty Slaps is a household name.
